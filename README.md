- 1. To use the NI-DAQ USB-6349, use:

  - 1.1 Plug in the  power supply (11-30V, 30W Max) 

  - 1.2 Use the printer usb cable to connect the NI-DAQ to the computer

  - 1.3 Turn on the device: switch at I position.

  - 1.4 To test that the NI-DAQ is connected to the computer, use NI-MAX (NI-MAX is the VISA application, to understand it, visit https://github.com/LaN-Tran/Automate_Lab_Instrument/tree/main) to detect the device. If the device appears, it is good. Otherwise, check whether any of the previous steps (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) have been missed.
